# Bioinformatics-Programming-Graphs-DFS-BFS-and-Gene-Expression

This repository contains solutions for **Problem Set 1** from the Algorithms in Bioinformatics course. The assignments focus on graph traversal algorithms and statistical analysis of gene expression data.

## Problem Overview
### P1: Graph Traversal Algorithms
- **Create Adjacency Matrix**: Build a graph's adjacency matrix from a CSV file containing edges.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Perform DFS on an adjacency matrix and return the resulting tree.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Perform BFS on an adjacency matrix and return the resulting tree.

### P3: Gene Expression Analysis
- Compare gene expression between healthy and cancer patients (10 samples each, 12,500 genes).
- Develop three statistical approaches to compute empirical p-values (e.g., mean, median, max).
- Compare results with t-test and Wilcoxon test for Type I and Type II error analysis.
